Using Newton Method to solve functions, or using steepest descent to optimize the function. In some physical systems they both resolve the same problem.



The special feature is one can include a `limitation = [[0, 1] for _ in range(0, n)]`  to avoid the solvation process out of the domain of x, which might be useful in some physical problem, where some value can not be negative.



free_energy.py includes some actual examples, which u wouldn't be interested in.
